## An Introduction to Java

The first release of Java in 1996 generated an incredible amount of excitement, not just in the computer press, but in mainstream media such as _The New York Times_, _The Washington Post_, and _Business Week_. Java has the distinction of being the first and only programming language that had a ten-minute story on National Public Radio. A $100,000,000 venture capital fund was set up solely for products produced by use of a specific computer language. It is rather amusing to revisit those heady times, and we give you a brief history of Java in this chapter.
